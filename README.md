## A Home Automation Project.

Project includes hadware (IOT Devices), mobile and web frontend with flutter and secure Backend using GO.

A user would buy the devices he needs, make an account adn login, configure his account, link devices to his account, configure his devices and use them in a interactive frontend.

I will add more details here later on how to setup and run the project. This project has 2 submodules for backend and frontend.
