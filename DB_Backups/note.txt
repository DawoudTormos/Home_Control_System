# PostgreSQL Backup and Restore Notes

## Backup

To create a backup of a PostgreSQL database, you can use the `pg_dump` utility. Here is an example command:


## Restore

To restore a PostgreSQL database from a backup, you can use the `psql` utility. Here is an example command:
psql -U username -d database_name -f backup_file.sql

###
You can also restore in pgAdmin 4 which is a db managment tool. (Like phpmyadmin with mysql) 
In pgAdmin 4:

    - make a databse named HCS
    - right click on public scheme
    - click restore
    - continue by restoring one of the backups (.backup)

For .sql:
    - make a databse named HCS
    - run the .sql file as query
